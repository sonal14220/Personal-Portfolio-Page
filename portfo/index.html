       they are short,  descriptions of a few projects I made to learn and practise:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI Emotion Detection</strong> — a small demo that analyses text or simple inputs to guess emotions and display results clearly.</li>
      <li><strong>AI Resume Builder</strong> — a tool that helps format and generate a clean resume from plain text or bullet points.</li>
      <li><strong>AI Fake Job Offer Detector</strong> — a project that looks for common signs of scam job postings. (Award: Winner in SAP Hackfest.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These projects are prototypes made for learning. They are not production-ready, but they show the ideas I am exploring.
